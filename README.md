iFuel uses a local JSON to show you some of the Gas Stations in Spain.
We use MapKit Annotations with a custom element, using MVVM architecture and a custom Navigation.

// This is a demo with a few gas stations. Data is not updated and some of the gas stations might be missplaced because error's at the JSON

Updated JSON can be found here:
